# Homework06
I created sections for the different elements which would go on this page, such as header, div, sections, etc. 
I added search button and a field for the user to input the city. 
I made a section for the information to be displayed and added the h4 and p elements for each field of data (temp, wind speed, etc.) in JS.
I made the UVI a span not a p in order to add the color to it later without padding issues. 
I added all elements and appended them to the page, putting them in a hidden class so they don't show up until the get weather button is clicked. 
I fetched the data in the APIs to get back the information requested. 
I created a for loop to transmit the 5 day forecast onto each card, using innerHTML.
I created if else statements regarding the UVI to make it's background various colors based on the rating (good, fair, bad) of the UVI. 
I will create buttons of the last 5 cities searched and store their information in the page's local storage. (not working yet.)
